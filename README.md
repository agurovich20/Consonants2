We intend to make our own version of the famous game "Oregon Trail" called "StuyTrail." In this game, the user
will have to use the command prompt to play the game, with no additional setup necessary. The player will 
encounter disasters, such as losing their metrocard, freezing from the cold, or being hit by a train. 
The player's goal is to make their way to Stuyvesant in time for the start of the schoolday. 

To start the game, clone the repo, then compile and run Woo.java.
```
git clone https://github.com/agurovich20/Consonants2.git <REPONAME>
cd <REPONAME>
javac Woo.java
java Woo
```
